## Data
The data is an updated version of the data used in Weber et. al. (2014). This data was requested by Anna Ritz in the early fall of 2016.The data is held in two files BadgerInfo.txt and BadgerMatrix.txt.

* __BadgerInfo.txt__.  This contains demographic information about the badgers in in the study.  It contains four columns: badger name, sex,whether or not they are infected with tuberculosis, and the social group the badger is a part of.

* __BadgerMatrix.txt__.  This contains the interaction data of the badgers.  This matrix is constructed as usual with each cell being the interaction between the row and colomn badger.  The number in the cell denotes the amount of time (minutes/seconds?) that the two badgers were in close contact
